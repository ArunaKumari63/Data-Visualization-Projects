As part of my Udemy course on Microsoft Power BI Desktop guided by Maven Analytics, I had the opportunity to work with the Maven Market dataset. This comprehensive dataset included valuable information about customers, transactions, products, and stores.

In this project, I focused on creating a marketing dashboard that answered key questions and provided insightful visualizations. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

1️⃣ Identified the product with the highest number of transactions, giving a clear picture of its significance in the market.

2️⃣ Calculated and showcased the total profit, total transactions, return rate, and profit margin for the current year. These metrics provided a comprehensive view of the business's performance.

3️⃣ Set a goal based on the previous month's data and evaluated whether it is achieved. This will allow to measure the success and identify areas for improvement.

4️⃣ Created a revenue target visualization, which enable to track progress and align the efforts with the overall business objectives.

5️⃣ Developed a visually appealing weekly report with revenue targets for each week. This helps to monitor performance on a regular basis and make informed decisions.

6️⃣ Identified the top customer(s) based on revenue, helps to understand the most valuable customers and prioritize the efforts accordingly.

7️⃣ Added an interactive map visual with navigation buttons, enhancing the user experience and allowing us to explore geographical data.
